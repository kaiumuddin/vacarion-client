                            <p>JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON object.

                                It is compact, readable and digitally signed using a private key/ or a public key pair by the Identity Provider(IdP). So the integrity and authenticity of the token can be verified by other parties involved.

                                The purpose of using JWT is not to hide data but to ensure the authenticity of the data. JWT is signed and encoded, not encrypted.

                                JWT is a token based stateless authentication mechanism. Since it is a client-side based stateless session, server doesn't have to completely rely on a datastore(database) to save session information.</p>
                            <p className="mt-2">Basically the identity provider(IdP) generates a JWT certifying user identity and Resource server decodes and verifies the authenticity of the token using secret salt / public key.</p>

                            <p>JavaScript is a simple programming language that can be used with any browser that has the JavaScript Engine installed. Node. js, on the other hand, is an interpreter or execution environment for the JavaScript programming language.</p>

                            <p>NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them.</p>
